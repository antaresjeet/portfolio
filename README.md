# Antares Jeet's Simple Portfolio ✨

Welcome to my "I-had-some-free-time-so-I-made-this" portfolio! This is a simpler, toned-down version of my main portfolio hosted at [antaresjeet.com](https://antaresjeet.com). 🦸‍♂️

## Features 🌟
- Sleek and minimal design (because simplicity is key).
- Completely responsive (looks great on both 4K monitors and your toaster screen).
- Easy to customize (yes, even for non-coders, I promise).
